"""Confirmed-vs-inferred contract, enforced in code — not in a prompt.

The reporter model proposes a report; this module is the gate that decides what
may be called "confirmed": only a finding citing a tool_call_id that exists in
the *verified* hash-chained audit log keeps that status. The model cannot talk
its way past this — enforcement is architectural, the same philosophy as the
guardrails.
