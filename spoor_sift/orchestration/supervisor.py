"""The Lead Investigator: a supervisor routing the case across the specialists.

One graph, four brains: the lead decides which phase comes next (triage →
IOC/correlation → report), re-routes on failures, and never touches evidence
itself — specialists own the tools. ``output_mode="full_history"`` keeps every
specialist's tool outputs (and their tool_call_ids) in the shared transcript,
which is exactly what the reporter's citation contract feeds on.

Known wart: with a custom ``state_schema``, langgraph 1.2.4 logs
"Task supervisor ... wrote to unknown channel remaining_steps, ignoring it" —
the supervisor's react agent emits its internal step counter upward and the
parent rightly discards it. Benign: step accounting stays correct inside each
agent; nothing case-related is lost.
