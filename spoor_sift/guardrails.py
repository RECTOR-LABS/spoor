"""Architectural guardrails: a filesystem path-jail and a binary allow-list.

These constraints are enforced in code, server-side — not in a model prompt — so
they hold even against a fully jailbroken agent. Two properties:

* **Path-jail**: every evidence path is resolved (symlinks included) and must lie
  within the evidence root; traversal, absolute escapes, and symlink escapes are
  rejected.
* **Allow-list**: only a fixed set of forensic binaries may ever be spawned, so an
  arbitrary shell command is impossible by construction.
